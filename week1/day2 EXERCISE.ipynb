       "\n",
       "**Key principles:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Be clear-eyed about what you want**: Recognize that wealth is not everything and make a commitment to create a life that aligns with your values.\n",
       "2. **Live below means, earn above wants**: Focus on achieving financial independence through frugality and investing, rather than chasing the latest luxury items or lifestyle upgrades.\n",
       "3. **Invest for the future, not just for today**: Build wealth over time, rather than trying to make quick money through get-rich-quick schemes or excessive risk-taking.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tips:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Cut back on unnecessary expenses**: Identify areas where you can reduce spending and allocate that money towards your goals.\n",
       "2. **Be intentional with your investments**: Consider investing carefully and avoid getting caught up in emotional decision-making.\n",
       "3. **Live below your means, invest elsewhere**: Focus on growing wealth through solid investments, rather than trying to save more or spend less.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Lessons:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Passion versus energy**: Recognize that passion is easy to get involved in, but energy for making a real difference through investing and hard work matters.\n",
       "2. **The importance of intentionality**: Understand the psychological barriers to financial success, including emotions and behavioral biases, and take steps to overcome them.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion:**\n",
